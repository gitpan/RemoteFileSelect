This is the first development version of Tk::RemoteFileSelect.pm,
Revision 0.52.

There's no installation program as yet; simply copy it 
into a local Tk/ subdirectory along the Perl @INC path,
and replace instances of 'FileSelect' with 'RemoteFileSelect.'

This module has been tested with Net::FTP from the libnet-1.703
distribution.  The RemoteFileSelect widget (as well as the calling
program!) must be able to load Net::FTP for remote file selection
to work.

Tk::RemoteFileSelect.pm is licensed under the same terms as Perl.
Please refer to the file "Artistic" in this archive.
